# Lancer Briefings

**[Live Demo](https://lancer.kuenaimaku.com/)** (No Room for a Wallflower Spoilers)

Go over mission briefings within the LANCER Universe in style by showing your players a fully animated mission briefing screen, with a Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company theme.

- Recommended VSCode extensions:
  - Color Info

  - npm Intellisense
  - Path Intellisense

## Setup

`npm install`

## Build Scripts

`npm run dev` - Serve the webapp with hot reloads (for development work)  
`npm run build` - Build for production  
`npm run serve OR npm run preview` - Locally preview production build  
`npm run format` - Format all code files using `prettier` based on rules set in `.prettierrc.json` (for development work)  

## Customization

Customization is handled in a couple of places.

### _base.css

This file holds a majority of the colors, fonts, and sizes of the webapp. Play around with the values in the marked customization section.

### Index.html

This file houses the [VantaJS](https://www.vantajs.com/) background used in the web application. Go to the site, mess with the different effect options, and once you're ready, replace the `VANTA.GLOBE` script with your customized one. Note that if you use a different effect, you'll have to replace the script url above it with one from [their CDN repository](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanta@latest/dist/).

### /public folder

This folder holds all of the local image, audio and video assets.

- `/faction-logos` - SVG files for the logos of each major faction, currently used for mapping icons to mech manufacturers.
- `/icons` - If you want to replace the icons used across the application, this is where you'd swap them.
- `/pilots` - This is where the images of pilots and their bios are held. Filenames MUST match the `callsign` property on pilots.
- `/mechs` - This is where the images of mechs are held. Filenames MUST match the `mech` property on pilots.
- `bullet.webp` - This replaces the default bullet point in Markdown areas.
- `planet.webm` - This is the planet rotation video used in the header.
- `startup.ogg` - This is the sound that plays on page load.

### /assets folder
- `/info/general-config.json` - Edit this to change which mission loads initially, set the pilot information, and other ease-of-use options that have been introduced to modify how the site works. Below are the values you might have to change.
  - `initialSlug` - Controls what mission file is selected on startup. This MUST match the slug of a markdown file within the `/public/missions/` directory.
  - `planetPath` - The path (relative to the root directory of this repository) to the .webm or .gif file to use for the planet video element.
  - `defaultTitle` - Sets the prefix for the title of each page (the text that shows up in your browser tab).
  - `icon` - The path (relative to the root directory of this repository) to the image that should be used for the favicon. This will be displayed in the browser tab for this website.
  - `header` - Reads from the `header` JSON object to determine what text to place on each element of the `Header.vue` Component.
  - `pilotSpecialInfo` - Currently only used for getting the `age` and place of birth (`pob`) for each pilot, based on their uppercased callsign.
- `/missions` - This is where the summaries of missions are held. The filename MUST match the `slug` property within the App's data.
- `/pilots` - This is where the json of pilots (exported from Comp/Con) are held. Filenames MUST match the `callsign` property on pilots.
- `/reserves` - This is where the json of reserves for the pilots are held. Any reserves on each individual pilot's exported data will also be added to the reserves.
- `/clocks` - This is where the json for relevant mission or overarching story Clocks are held. You can add and configure clocks by adding or modifying json objects to the list.

### App.vue

This file contains the basic structure of the entire application - and houses the data for all the various places. Find the `created()` method within App.vue, here you will find the directories that are used for importing the general configuration information and all of the data for each page. Below is a general description of each object and relevant sub-objects.

- `missions` - An array of `.md` files representing missions. Where the first 3 lines map to the `slug` `name` and `status`, respectively, followed by the `content` in the rest of the file.
  - `slug` - Controls what markdown file is selected when this mission is selected. This MUST match a markdown file within the `/assets/missions/` directory.
  - `name` - Controls what name the mission has in the mission list.
  - `status` - Controls what badge the mission has. Acceptable values are `start`, `partial-success`, `success`, and `failure`.
  - `content` - The actual content that gets displayed for the mission when selected.
- `pilots` - An array of json objects representing Lancer Pilots. Export your Pilot(s) from Comp/Con and put their .json files in the `/assets/pilots` directory.
  - `callsign` - Controls what appears in the callsign section of the pilot roster. MUST match pilot portraits and biography markdown files within the `/assets/pilots/` directory.
  - `alias` - Controls what appears in the Name or Legal Alias section of the pilot roster.
  - `code` - Controls what appears underneath the Name or Legal Alias section of the pilot roster.
  - `corpro` - Controls what appears first in the mech's header section.
  - `frame` - Controls what appears second in the mech's header section.
  - `mech` - Controls what appears under the mech's header section. MUST match mech images within the `/public/mechs/` directory.

## Hosting Recommendations

I would strongly recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting, as there's no cost for hosting, has Continuous Deployment, and they'll provide a url. Register for an account, and click the `New Site from Git` button.
On the next page, pick the git service you used to fork this repo with, and authenticate. On the next page, select the `lancer-briefings` repository. If you can't see the repository listed on the page, click the `Canâ€™t see your repo here? Configure the Netlify app on <git site>` link at the bottom of the page.
Finally, make sure the branch being deployed is `master`, the `base directory` field is blank, the `build command` is `npm run build`, and the publish directory is `dist`.

Once the site builds remotely, click on the link provided in the `site overview` tab and make sure everything looks right.

Alternatively, if you use github, you can probably rely on github-pages. Take a look at the [vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) for more info.

## Usage within FoundryVTT

install the [Inline Webviewer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/inlinewebviewer) module and use the new button to send websites to your players - namely this one. Best viewed at 1920x1080.
